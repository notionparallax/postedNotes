A handwritten letter is a beautiful thing, but maybe you don't have a stamp or you forget to go to the post office--_something_ always gets in the way of mailing that letter.

If this sounds like you then Posted Notes is here to help!

We take _your_ text and turn it into a beautiful, handwritten note. We put a stamp on it and post it.

It costs $5 each letter, that's it. We've kept it really simple so all you need to think about are the words.

We write every letter by hand on A5 paper and put it into a matching envelope. We'll write the address on the front and pop it in the mail.
