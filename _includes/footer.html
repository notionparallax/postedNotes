    <h3><a id="rules"></a>The Rules</h3>
    <p>We'd love to spend all day writing thank you cards for grandmas, love letters, anonymous high five letters and other feel good things. We don't mind if you get us to write letters to your landlord or pleas for the library to let you off your fines. We'll even politely fire all your staff or tell someone how terribly rude they are. We won't send death threats or Ransom notes.</p>
    <p>When you tick the box above you are agreeing to the following:</p>
    <p>I grant Posted Notes permission to transcribe this content and post it to the specified recipient on my behalf. I have proof-read the message and understand that it will be transcribed as is. I agree that the content is not deceptive, illegal, malicious nor harmful. In the event that the communication is deemed unsolicited by anyone involved in this transaction, Posted Notes will not be held liable for any damages, legal or otherwise, resulting from this letter. I understand that Posted Notes reserves the right to reject my order for any reason. I understand that there will be no tracking information for my letter.</p>

    <h3>Privacy</h3>
    <p>We promise we won't read your letters <a href="http://youtu.be/O1eOsMc2Fgg">out loud</a> or let anyone else do that either. They go directly to one of our scribes and then once they are in the letterbox nobody will see them again. The only place your data gets stored is with paypal, and their security makes most banks look lax!</p>
    <h3>Thanks</h3>
